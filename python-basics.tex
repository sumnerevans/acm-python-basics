\begin{frame}{A Small Survey}
    Welcome everyone! I'd like to get to know everyone a bit more and get a feel
    for everyone's prior experience with programming and Python.

    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item What year are you in?
        \item How many of you have programmed in any language before?
        \item How many of you have programmed in \textbf{Python} before?

\section{What is Python?}

\begin{frame}{A Bit of History}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Python first appeared in early 1991. \emph{This means that Python
            is older than Java and Ruby.}
        \item Guido van Rossum (GvR, the creator of Python) designed his
            language with \textbf{emphasis on readability}.
        \item Python was named after \emph{Monty Python's Flying Circus}.
        \item The language quickly gained popularity because of its appeal to
            long-time UNIX/C hackers\footnote{See the Jargon File on hackers
            vs.  crackers}.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Why Learn Python?}
    \begin{itemize}[<+->]
        \item Python is a \textit{general purpose, multi-paradigm} language
            meaning that it is very flexible and can be used in many different
            scenarios.
        \item Some of the main applications of Python in industry are web
            programming, data science, machine learning, automation scripting.
        \item Python is an easy language to learn.
        \item Python runs anywhere, and generally requires little setup compared
            to other languages.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A Note on Python 2 and Python 3}
    There are two main versions of Python: Python 2 and Python 3. As of earlier
    this year, Python 2 is no longer supported, so nobody should use it.
    Unfortunately, many projects and operating systems have not gotten with the
    times and are still reliant on Python 2.

    \pause
    Python 3 has many major advantages over Python 2 as it fixes many annoying
    inconsistencies with the older version.

    \pause
    For the purposes of this presentation, we will be talking \emph{strictly of
    Python 3}.
\end{frame}

\section{Programming Basics in Python}

\begin{frame}{Follow Along}
    You can either install Python on your machine or use an online Python
    environment such as \url{https://repl.it/languages/Python3}.

    Most of the things we will cover today can be done directly in the REPL
    (read-evaluate-print-loop) on the right, however you may want to write code
    in the file on the left and run it.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Storing Data}
    At its core, programming is about storing and manipulating \textit{data}.

    \pause
    In almost every programming language, there is a concept of a
    \textbf{variable} which \textit{stores} data.

    \pause
    In Python, you can create a variable using the following syntax:
    \begin{minted}{python}
        name = "Sumner"
        age = 22
        likes_acm = True
    \end{minted}

    \textit{If you have ever programmed in a language such as Java, you may
    notice that there is no special keyword for declaring a variable.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Showing the Data}
    Storing data isn't any good unless you can actually use it for something
    useful. \pause One of the most basic things we can do with the data stored
    is print it out to the console.

    To print anything in Python, use the \texttt{print} function:
    \begin{minted}{python}
        name = "Sumner"
        age = 22
        print(name)
        print(age)
    \end{minted}

    \pause
    If you want to print multiple things at once, you can separate them with a
    comma:
    \begin{minted}{python}
        print(name, age)
    \end{minted}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Getting Data From the User}
    Often, we want to get some input from the user and store it in a variable.
    \pause To do this in Python, we use the \texttt{input} function.

    \begin{minted}{python}
        name = input()
        print("Hello", name)
    \end{minted}

    \pause
    We can also optionally include prompt text:
    \begin{minted}{python}
        age = int(input("How old are you? "))
        print("In one year, you will be", age + 1, "years old")
    \end{minted}

    \pause
    What do you think the difference between \texttt{input()} and
    \texttt{int(input())} is?
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{What Sorts of Data Can We Store?}
    There are many different \textit{types} of data that we can store in Python.
    Here are the most basic data types (primitives):

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{bool} --- either \texttt{True} or \texttt{False}
        \item \texttt{int} --- an integer
        \item \texttt{float} --- a real number\footnote[frame]{Not all real
            numbers can be represented as a floating point number, but that's
            not normally important.}
        \item \texttt{string} --- a sequence of characters\footnote[frame]{Note
            that unlike other languages, there is no \texttt{char} datatype.
            Chars are just one-character strings.}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Manipulating Data: Assigning a New Value to a Variable}
    Having variables to store is nice, but a lot of times we want to modify the
    value stored in the variable!

    To do that, we use a very similar syntax to defining variables:
    \begin{minted}{python}
        name = "Sumner"  # declares a variable and gives it an
                         # initial value
        print(name)

        name = "Jack"    # assigns the value "Jack" to the "name"
                         # variable
        print(name)
    \end{minted}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Manipulating Data: Basic Operations}
    Similar to how you can perform operations on variables in algebra, you can
    perform operations on variables. Here are some basic operations on primitive
    data types in Python:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{+}, \texttt{-}, \texttt{*}, \texttt{/}, \texttt{//}: add,
            subtract, multiply, divide, integer division.
        \item \texttt{**}: exponentiate ($3^8$ would be written \texttt{3**8}).
        \item \texttt{<}, \texttt{>}, \texttt{==}: tests if two numbers are less
            than, greater than, equal to each other, respectively.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Try it Yourself!}
    \textbf{Try creating a few different variables of various types and
    performing operations on them.}

    A few examples to get you started:
    \begin{minted}{python}
        pi = 3.14159265
        r = 10
        print("diameter =", pi * (r ** 2))

        email = input("Enter your email: ")
        email_again = input("Verify your email: ")
        print(email == email_again)
    \end{minted}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Making Decisions: Selection Using \texttt{if}}
    It's all well and good that we can compare numbers and get a boolean value,
    but we need to make \textit{decisions} with that information. That's where
    \textbf{\texttt{if} statements} come in.

    \pause
    The syntax for \texttt{if} statements in Python is:
    \begin{minted}{python}
        if condition1:
            # do whatever is in this indented section if condition1
            # is True
        elif condition2:
            # do whatever is in this indented section if condition2
            # is True
        else:
            # do whatever is in this indented section otherwise
    \end{minted}

    You can have arbitrary many \texttt{elif} blocks (including no elif blocks).
    It is also not necessary to have an \texttt{else} block.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Making Decisions: Selection Using \texttt{if}: Example}
    Here is a simple example of an \texttt{if} statement at work:
    \begin{minted}{python}
        likes_python = input("Do you like Python? (y/n)")
        if likes_python == "y":
            print("You like Python!")
        elif likes_python == "n":
            print("You don't like Python :(")
        else:
            print("I don't know if you like Python...")
    \end{minted}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Making Decisions: Selection Using \texttt{if}: Your Turn!}
    \textbf{Now it's your turn!} Try to write some Python which does the
    following:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Creates a variable with a secret number of your choice.
        \item Asks the user to guess a number.
        \item Tells the user if their guess is above, below, or equal to the
            secret number.
    \end{enumerate}

    \textit{Extra Credit:} Look up the documentation for the
    \texttt{random.randint} function and see if you can make the secret number
    random.
